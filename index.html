			A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, “to write beside” or “written
			beside”) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing
			with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more
			sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language,
			paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to
			organize longer prose.
